                As technology and medicine improve, wars become less frequent, and countries develop, the overall life expectancy of countries and the world has increased between 2000 and 2015.
            </p>

        <div class="pure-u-1-3">
            <p>
                The world shows on overall increasing trend of life expectancy, however, there still is a clear divide between <span class="developed-text"> developed nations </span>, such as seen in Europe and the Americas, 
                and  <span class="developing-text"> developing nations, </span> as is seen in places such as Africa and Asia.

            <p>
                In particular, Sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian subcontinent are the areas that show the lowest average life expectancy, but also has had some of the biggest increases in life expectancy between 2000 and 2015.

                The above graph displays the trend of average life expectancy of <span class="developed-text">developed nations</span> and <span class="developing-text">developing nations.</span> The general trend for both regions of the world is a slow increase across the 15 years shown.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="pure-u-1-3">
            <p>
                The gap between these two areas of the world has only shurnk marginally, meaning that the increase in life expectancy, and therefore the development of things that improve life expectancy, is happening at a similar rate in both regions of the world.
            </p>

        <div class="pure-u-1-3">
            <p>
                However, the increase of life expectancy of the <span class="developed-text">developed world</span> has stagnated from around 2010 onwards, meaning that there may be an upper limit to human life expectancy with our current technology and medicine.

                The income composition of resources measures how good a country is at utilising resources. The better a country is at allocating and using resources, the higher their score is.
                In general, <span class="developed-text">developed countries</span> have a higher income composition of resources than <span class="developing-text">developing countries, </span>which also strongly correlates to a higher life expectancy.

                The rate of adult mortality in a country shows to have a trend with life expectancy, with a lower adult mortality in general leading to a higher life expectancy. 
                However, there is also a gap in this trend, and a second trend line where a lot of countries with low adult mortalities also have a lower life expectancy, as seen in the line on the left.

                The level of education the average person in a country receives is strongly correlated with the country's life expectancy. Countries where people are able and wanting to spend more years in school generally correlate with country development, 
                as <span class="developed-text">developed countries </span>have a higher average amount of years spent in schooling than <span class="developing-text">developing countries.</span>

                The five countries that had the highest life expectancies are: <span class="japan-text"> Japan, </span><span class="swiss-text"> Switzerland, </span>
                <span class="ice-text"> Iceland, </span><span class="italy-text"> Italy, </span> and <span class="swede-text">Sweden.</span>
                These top 5 countries are all <span class="developed-text">developed countries</span>, and are mostly European with the exception of Japan. 
                Since 2004, all of the top 5 countries' life expectancies have been higher than 80 years old.
            </p>
            <p>
                The rankings change quite frequently, as the difference in life expectancies is relatively small between the top few countries,
                so small fluctuations in life expectancy from year to year can cause the rankings to vary significantly.

                A majority of the nations in the world are still developing, with <span class="developing-text">83%</span> of nations being classed as 
                <span class="developing-text">developing</span>, and only a small minority of <span class="developed-text">17%</span> of nations being classed as

                However, as development of countries continues as time moves on, the trends shown indicate that the average life expectancy is likely to increase into the future.
